# Further information on data input

## Input image filenames
Currently images must have filenames generated by autographer cameras, similar to:  `B00000895_21I7IV_20170314_134407E.JPG`.

The format is `AAAAAAAAA_BBBBBB_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSE.JPG`.

Where YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS are: year, month, day, hour, minute, second. The AAAAAAAA should be a sequence number indicating which order the images were taken in. e.g. B00000023 for the 23rd image, but exact number doesn't matter.

In future the metadata 'Date Created' of the file will be used if the name is not the correct format.


## Browser automated resizing
After updating file_paths.json open the browser and it should begin creating 'thumbnail' and 'medium' size images. This may take some time but only needs to be done once. You should see a screen like the below, and when the queue is empty click on the participant to see the images.

### Tip to speed up resizing of images
It is much faster to use the utility linux/mac script below to resize a participant's images:
```bash
bash utilities/create_thumbnails.sh /study/camera/P001/
```

If you have many participants images to resize, please refer to the [utilities](utilities/readme.md) page where the ... python script writes out the above list of commands for each participant and the GNU parallel command then processes the commands in parallel.


## Removing participants' data
To remove a participant, simply delete their images folder while the browser is not running. If you have made any annotations they will also have a participant folder in the 'annotations' folder, so after it is backed up delete this too.
