## Adding a new participant

Each participant has their own folder in the 'images' directory. Create a new folder (Windows: `Ctrl-shift-N`), with the name of the participant.

Within the folder copy over your images. Images currently need to be type .jpg (or .jpeg) and must have file name like: 

![in participant folder](http://i.imgur.com/VYWLIPO.png)

Now start the browser, the browser should begin creating 'thumbnail' and 'medium' size images to speed up browsing. This may take a short time but only needs to be done once. You should see a screen like the below, and when the queue is empty click on the participant to see the images.

To remove a participant, simply delete their images folder while the browser is not running. If you have made any annotations they will also have a participant folder in the 'annotations' folder, delete this too.

## Image filenames

Currently images must have filenames generated by autographer cameras, similar to:  `B00000895_21I7IV_20170314_134407E.JPG`.

The format is `AAAAAAAAA_BBBBBB_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSSE.JPG`.

Where YYYY, MM, DD, HH, MM, SS are: year, month, day, hour, minute, second. The AAAAAAAA should be a sequence number indicating which order the images were taken in. e.g. B00000023 for the 23rd image, but exact number doesn't matter.

In future the metadata 'Date Created' of the file will be used if the name is not the correct format.

## Selecting schema

A schema is simply a list of different labels used to annotate your images. The browser comes with two schemas we have used with wearable camera images, one contains only 7 classes & an 'unknown' class, the second is a more detailed schema based on the [Compendium of Physical Activities](https://sites.google.com/site/compendiumofphysicalactivities/) for which exact energy expenditure values are known.

To select a schema simply press the book button and choose an option from below. Each participant can have seperate annotations using different schemas. E.g. for studying how being outdoors affects activity you could have one schema for 'primary activity', another for 'secondary activity' and a third one for 'indoor/outdoor'. 

## Annotating images

Images are split up into events, which can then be annotated. To split an event into two, click on the line between two images as below:

This split is where I think the participant has started locking up their bike.

To move event boundaries, click and drag the circles. To delete an event simply drag another event over it.

Depending on the schema you have selected, you should see different annotations in the side-bar. Dragging these onto an event will annotate it. Your annotations are automatically saved to a file, so it is safe to close the browser or change schema, they will be there when you re-select the same schema.

## Exporting annotations

Annotations can be downloaded as a .csv file by pressing the 'downward-arrow' button. The file will have 3 columns as shown below.

All the annotations are stored in the 'annotations' folder. The files are not large so this folder can be copied if you want to back up your work. If you want to restore a specific one e.g. annotations for 'sven' using the 7-class.csv schema, then copy the file `/annotation/sven/annotation_7-class.csv` (while the browser is closed).
## Custom schemas

The browser comes with two schema .csv files, which can be modified, copied or deleted. The annotations are simply one annotation per-line. If you wish to define your own schema simply copy one of the existing ones, and add/remove rows as you see fit. You can use either a text editor (Notepad), or Excel. If using Excel make sure to save as .csv, as .xls files will not be recognised. 

Excel may warn you when saving a .csv file, ignore these messages (select yes).

### Special characters
Semicolons (;) are use to define folders, e.g.
```
activity;outdoor;running
activity;outdoor;walking
activity;indoor;running
activity;indoor;walking
```

## Development

To work on this project `git clone` this repository and use the `npm start` command to run a test instance, the program will automatically reboot after any changes to source code. Most application logic is in `/static/main.html`, except image resizing and schema parsing which live in `/image_resize.js` and `/schema.js`.

Once built there are no external dependencies, however development requires node.js and npm installed. Run `npm install` to install required modules. This program is written in [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/), so a good read of their docs is recommended.

To build a distributable program for your OS run `npm run-script build`. This will generate e.g. SvenBrowser-win32-x64 (if you are on 64-bit windows).
